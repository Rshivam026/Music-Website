#Music WebSite
The Project is made using HTML, CSS(Bootstrap to some extent), and JavaScript.
Here We have assumed that we are fetching the song from some external files (object.txt here), which contain a link to the music, name of the song, and image of the song.
We Have a list of the song here, which are populated using javascript in the desired place as soon as the window is loaded.
We have added an event listener to search in the navigation bar, showing all the songs containing the value entered in the search box.
